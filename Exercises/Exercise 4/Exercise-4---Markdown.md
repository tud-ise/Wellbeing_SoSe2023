Exercise 4
================

## Wellbeing - Test Data Set

For this exercise, we will focus on a test data set, which is a
simulated combination of *RescueTime* data (anonymized by category - see
RescueTime Exercise), a wellness activity, and survey data. Please be
aware that the data set contains no real case data, so the results we
receive in this exercise are not to be taken seriously.

The data set contains 1,200 entries with 44 attributes:

**Data set attributes**

**Download**

Please download the [data set from our github
repository](https://github.com/tud-ise/Wellbeing_SoSe2023/blob/main/Exercises/Exercise%204/all_data_1.csv).

## Data Preparation

**Open the data set**

    data = read.csv("**Your Path** /all_data_1.csv")
    df = data

**Check the data structure**

    summary(df)
    str(df)

    summary(df[, 5:9]) # Life Satisfaction
    str(df[,11:22]) # RescueTime data

**Group items**

We had multiple items (questions) to measure specific characteristics.
To analyze the overall characteristic, we have to calculate the mean for
each characteristic using each item.

*Life Satisfaction*

      df$total_Life_satisfaction = (df$life_satisfaction_item_1 + df$life_satisfaction_item_2 + df$life_satisfaction_item_3 + df$life_satisfaction_item_4 + df$life_satisfaction_item_5) / 5
      

*Technostress*

    df$TS_CTRL = (df$esm_technostress_control_1 + df$esm_technostress_control_2)/2

    df$TS_NEG = (df$esm_technostress_negative_1 + df$esm_technostress_negative_2 
             + df$esm_technostress_negative_3 + df$esm_technostress_negative_4 + df$esm_technostress_negative_5)/5

    df$TS_POS = (df$esm_technostress_positive_1 + df$esm_technostress_positive_2 
             + df$esm_technostress_positive_3 + df$esm_technostress_positive_4 + df$esm_technostress_positive_5)/5

*Positive/Negative affects*

    df$distressed = df$esm_panas_na_distressed
    df$irritable = df$esm_panas_na_irritable
    df$jittery = df$esm_panas_na_jittery
    df$nervous = df$esm_panas_na_nervous
    df$upset = df$esm_panas_na_upset
    df$active = df$esm_panas_pa_active
    df$determined = df$esm_panas_pa_determined
    df$enthusiastic = df$esm_panas_pa_enthusiastic
    df$excited = df$esm_panas_pa_excited
    df$inspired = df$esm_panas_pa_inspired

    df$PA = (df$excited + df$enthusiastic + df$inspired + df$active + df$determined)/5
    df$NAS = (df$distressed + df$irritable + df$jittery + df$nervous + df$upset)/5

**Adjust *RecueTime* data**

The RescueTime data has ‘NA’ if a category is not used at all.
Regression models do often not handle NA values; because of that, we
will replace the ’NA’s with zeros.

    df[is.na(df)] = 0 

**Format Columns**

The column `date` is currently loaded as character (`chr`). If we want
to work with a `time series` we need to format the date column into the
`date` format.

    library(lubridate)
    df$date = mdy(df$date)

Most regression libraries will expect a `factor` instead of `character`
or `numeric` as categorical variables. Therefore we transform the data
type of `id`, `sex` and `wellness_act` into `factors`:

    df$id = as.factor(df$id)
    df$sex = as.factor(df$sex)
    df$wellness_act = as.factor(df$wellness_act)

test = data

Test if all transformations were successful:

    str(df[,1:10])

**Create single user data frame**

It could be interesting to take a look at a single user as well (for
example, your own data). The easiest way is to create a second data
frame that contains just one specific user.

    df_sgl = df[df$id == 2,] 
    summary(df_sgl)

## Data Analysis

### Descriptive Statistics

First, we should use descriptive statistics to describe and summarize
the data.

**Examples**

What is the average age of our participants?

    mean(df$age)

How are the genders distributed in our data set?

     table(df$sex)
     

What is your/the single users’ average time on social media?

    mean(df_sgl$st_Social.Networking_time, na.rm=TRUE) 

Have male participants used more time with networking apps than female
participants?

    mean(df[df$sex == 0, 18], na.rm=TRUE) #Social networking time = column 18 
    mean(df[df$sex == 1, 18], na.rm=TRUE) #Result is the same, that is not a misstake, it is because the data set was generated this way

**Graphs**

In addition, graphs are a strong tool to visualize and describe a data
set. Important R-functions are ‘hist()’ and ‘plot()’

How is the age of our participants distributed?

    hist(df$age, xlab = "Alter")

Plot between time on social & networking and age.

    plot(df$age, df$st_Social.Networking_time, xlab = "Alter", ylab = "Networking time")

**Your Turn**

Try to find some interesting numbers or insights using descriptive
statistics.

### Regression

Next, we take a look at inferential statistics to see if we have
statistically significant effects.

**OLS Regression**

We can use a simple OLS regression (Exercise 3) to analyze the data of
one specific group, such as “your own” data (df_sgl).

Let’s test if we can find a significant effect of screen time per
category on your life satisfaction.

    wlb_ols = lm(df_sgl$PA ~ df_sgl$st_Software.Development_numberOfApplications)

    summary(wlb_ols)

**Panel Regression**

To analyze the whole data set, we have to pick the correct model which
fits to the data structure. As we already learned, the data set is based
on panel data, which we can analyze with a panel regression. In this
exercise we will use the ‘plm()’ function from the ‘plm’ package to run
our panel regression.

*Install library*

    install.packages("plm")

    library("plm")

*Prepare data*

    E = pdata.frame(df, index=c("id","date"), drop.index=TRUE, row.names=TRUE)

    head(E)

    head(attr(E, "index"))

*Run regression*

    panel_reg = plm(PA ~ wellness_act + sex + age + total_Life_satisfaction + TS_POS + TS_NEG  + st_Entertainment_numberOfApplications + st_Entertainment_time, data = E, model = "random")

    summary(panel_reg)


    panel_reg = plm(NAS ~ wellness_act + sex + age + total_Life_satisfaction + TS_POS + TS_NEG  + st_Entertainment_numberOfApplications + st_Entertainment_time, data = E, model = "random")

    summary(panel_reg)
