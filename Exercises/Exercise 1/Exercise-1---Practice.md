# Exercise Number 1: Introduction to R - Exercises

## Christopher Diebel & Jan-Hendrik Schmidt - ISE Darmstadt

## Preparation

1. Even if you work with R every day, it is (almost) impossible to remember all the functions. R has a very good built-in help system, but it is not very easy to understand for beginners. This is accessible in the Help section. If you want to search specifically, you can enter a term in the Help Viewer search window. If you simply want to find out what features are available in an installed package, you can search for a package in the Packages area and then click on it to see the help pages.
1. If you want to get quick help on a function in the console, you can proceed like this: `help(mean)` - This opens the help page for the mean function. Alternatively, you can also enter `?mean`. 
1. One can also search for help on a topic. For example, if you need help on rounding numbers up or down, you can type `help("round")`. More help on the `help()` function can be found like this: `help(help)`.


## Practice Exercises

### Operators and Numerical Functions
Calculate using RStudio:

```R
(1/3)*((1+3+5+7+2)/(3+5+4))
```
2. How can you calculate <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;e}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} e}" /> 
```R
exp(1)
```
3. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;\sqrt{2}}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} \sqrt{2}}" /> 
```R
sqrt(2)
```
4. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;\sqrt[3]{8}}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} \sqrt[3]{8}}" /> 
```R
8^(1/3)
```
5. <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;log_2(8)}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} log_2(8)}" /> 
```R
log2(8)
```

### Statistical Functions

1. Create a sequence from 0 to 100 in steps of 5
```R
seq(0, 100, 5)
```
2. Calculate the mean value of the vector [1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 2].
```R
mean(c(1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 2))
```
3. Display the span <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline&space;\large&space;\dpi{120}{\color{Emerald}&space;x_{max}&space;-&space;x_{min}}" title="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.image?\inline \large \dpi{120}{\color{Emerald} x_{max} - x_{min}}" /> of this vector.
```R
range(c(1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 2))
```
4. Calculate the sum of this vector.
```R
sum(c(1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 2))
```

### Data Frames
One advantage of packages like `tidyverse` is that sample data is often included, making it particularly clear why the packages are useful. We use the tibble `starwars` from the `tidyverse` package.

#### Homework Task

0. Get to know the dataset 'starwars'

```R
starwars
View(starwars)
```

1. Who is the shortest character?
```R
starwars %>% 
  arrange((height))
```

2. Find all characters from  Tatooine.
```R
starwars %>%
   filter(hometown == 'Tatooine')
```

Other questions you might explore:

3. How many droids are there?

4. What is the home world of Han Solo?

5. How many characters are there per species? Sort by ascending count.

6. Change the height from `cm`to `m`.

7. Filter out all characters that have missing values (`NA`) for their mass. How many are left?
